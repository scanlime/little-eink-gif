# Little Eink Gif

It's a simple animated image viewer and proof-of-concept for the 2.1" 72x172 pixel electrophoretic display (EPD) from Dalian Good Display Co.

These EPDs are a specific type of bi-stable display from the broad category known as e-paper or e-ink. These tiny EPDs are commonly manufactured for use in retail price signage, but you can buy modules and development kits from sites like aliexpress.

This display is model GDE021A1, and the controller claims to be SPD2701.
